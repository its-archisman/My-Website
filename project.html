        <li><b>Modelled one dimensional collisions of a system of particles using Binary Heap:</b> 
            Given a system of particles (in 1D) with different 
            masses, initial speeds, and positions, I calculated the details of the 
            collisions (such as position, particle type, and time of occurrence) 
            that would occur until a given time or until a specified number of 
            collisions were reached.

           <b>Emulated Google Map's “Search Nearby” feature:</b> Implemented it in 
                the most efficient way possible by using “Range Trees” and 
                minimizing the time complexity.

            <b>Created a database of employees in a company using Binary Trees: </b>The algorithm could fetch data much faster than brute-force 
            methods.

            <b>Pattern matching using modified Rabin-Karp Algorithm: </b>
                Modified the traditional Rabin-Karp algorithm by introducing an error factor which will take care of the number of false positives that are reported.
                Also calculated a suitable range which the offset can take in order to preserve the correctness of the algorithm.
